### Description:

APRESIASI is a mobile application that helps users navigate traffic congestion by:

- Predicting traffic conditions: Utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to analyze real-time and historical traffic data to predict future traffic flow.
- Recommending optimal routes: Suggests the fastest and most efficient route based on predicted traffic conditions and user preferences.
- Providing real-time traffic updates: Displays live traffic information, including congestion levels and accident reports.
- Offering alternative routes: Presents users with alternative routes to avoid traffic jams.

### Target Users:

- Commuters (drivers, public transport users, ride-sharing users)

### Features:

- Real-time traffic map: Visualizes current traffic conditions on an interactive map.
- Traffic prediction: Provides insights into future traffic flow based on AI analysis.
- Alternative route suggestions: Recommends alternative routes to bypass congestion.
- Personalized preferences: Allows users to set preferences like travel time optimization or avoiding toll roads.
- Weather information: Displays weather data that might affect traffic flow.
